# JavaPathfindingGUI

This is a Java-based project that implements pathfinding algorithms using a graphical user interface. It includes both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), allowing users to visualize how these algorithms work step by step.

### Features

- DFS and BFS pathfinding algorithms  
- Graphical interface using Java Swing  
- Custom implementation of Stack and Queue data structures  
- Reads grid/map data from a CSV file  
- Basic result display and step-by-step traversal

### Technologies Used

- Java  
- Java Swing  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- File handling and custom data structures

### Notes

This project was originally developed as a group assignment. I later revised and structured the code for personal use and portfolio purposes.
